# A two-tier architecture for a single-page application

The purpose of this project is to quickly deploy a simple, two-tier architecture in the AWS cloud for a single-page application using IaC. This architecture reflects best practices when deploying an Application Load Balancer thatâ€™s open to the internet as per [AWS Prescriptive Guidance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/load-balancer-stickiness/subnets-routing.html). The solution is written in HCL which is Terraform's domain-specific language.

The components involved are the following:

* VPC
* EC2
* Auto-scaling group (ASG)
* Application load balancer (ALB)
* Security groups

## Traffic flow

**1)** HTTP traffic is transmitted from the client to the ALB which is the first point of entry.

**2)** The ALB forwards the traffic to the healthy, backend EC2 instances which host the web application.

**3)** Thanks to the NAT gateway, return traffic from the isolated, private subnets makes its way back to the ALB.

**4)** The web site is served to the client.


## Usage
This code assumes that you have already Terraform installed locally. For instructions on how to install Terraform, please refer to Hashicorp's documentation [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install).

To deploy this solution, please follow the instructions below.
  
**1)** Clone the repository locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/nick22d/webapp.git
```

**2)** Navigate into the repository:

```
cd webapp/
```

**3)** Run the following commands in the order written:

```
terraform init
```

```
terraform apply --auto-approve
```

**4)** Verify functionality by browsing to the DNS name of the ALB returned in the output with the command below:

```
curl http://<dns name of the ALB>
```
